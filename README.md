# OKDDip
**O**nline **K**nowledge **D**istillation with **Di**verse **P**eers (AAAI-2020) https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00350

This is a PyTorch-1.0 implementation of the OKDDip algorithm together with the compared approaches (such as classic KD and online variants like ONE, CL-ILR, DML). 

This paper attempts to alleviate homogenization problem during training of student models. Specifically, OKDDip performs two-level distillation during training with multiple auxiliary peers and one group leaders. In the first-level distillation, each auxiliary peer holds an individual set of aggregation weights generated with an attention-based mechanism to derive its own targets from predictions of other auxiliary peers. The second-level distillation is performed to transfer the knowledge in the ensemble of auxiliary peers further to the group leader, i.e., the model used for inference.

```
python train_kd.py --model resnet32 --T_model resnet110 --T_model_path ./CIFAR10/resnet110 --dataset CIFAR10
```

### 3. OKDDip 

Train **resnet32** model on **CIFAR10** dataset.
